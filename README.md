OpenSHARE Mission
-----------------

The mission of this project is to help researchers to "discover more, faster" by initiating an open
data-sharing project within the developmental science community. We will create a community of open
collaboration and data sharing by removing professional barriers to sharing and by developing two
enabling software tools.

OpenSHARE is a proposed web-based environment in which researchers can
release raw video data, other data streams, and associated metadata under a creative commons
license, browse others' data, and perform further analyses on others' data that can extend or even
transform the community's understanding. OpenSHARE will also enable sharing of visualization and
analysis tools and algorithms, and support interoperability and exchange. OpenSHAPA is emerging
open-source software that helps researchers to integrate and synchronize data streams in multiple
media, view their data, code it, explore it, visualize it, and analyze it.

OpenSHAPA provides a common format that makes it easy for researchers to view each other's data,
and it also provides information that OpenSHARE can exploit to help researchers find the data they need. However, researchers won't be
"forced" to use OpenSHAPA because we will build interoperability between OpenSHAPA and other favored
coding tools. Together, OpenSHARE, OpenSHAPA, and other tools contributed to the project will encourage
deeper, richer understanding of development and behavior.
