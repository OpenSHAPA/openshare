<h2>OpenSHARE Mission</h2>
<p>
The mission of this project is to help researchers to "discover more, faster" by initiating an open
data-sharing project within the developmental science community. We will create a community of open
collaboration and data sharing by removing professional barriers to sharing and by developing two
enabling software tools.
</p>
<p>
OpenSHARE is a proposed web-based environment in which researchers can
release raw video data, other data streams, and associated metadata under a creative commons
license, browse others' data, and perform further analyses on others' data that can extend or even
transform the community's understanding. OpenSHARE will also enable sharing of visualization and
analysis tools and algorithms, and support interoperability and exchange. OpenSHAPA is emerging
open-source software that helps researchers to integrate and synchronize data streams in multiple
media, view their data, code it, explore it, visualize it, and analyze it.
</p>
<p>
OpenSHAPA provides a common
format that makes it easy for researchers to view each other's data, and it also provides information
that OpenSHARE can exploit to help researchers find the data they need. However, researchers won't be
"forced" to use OpenSHAPA because we will build interoperability between OpenSHAPA and other favored
coding tools. Together, OpenSHARE, OpenSHAPA, and other tools contributed to the project will encourage
deeper, richer understanding of development and behavior.

<h2>Working Plan: FAQ</h2>
<h3>Why should I contribute my data or tools to an open data sharing facility?</h3>
<p>
A history of data sharing and a plan to commit data to an open share will enhance the likelihood of funding. Federal funding agencies and private foundations are now requesting data management and data sharing plans.
Your work will receive more citations. Users will cite your data set or tools and the papers associated with them.
</p>
<h3>Will I receive credit for my contributions if other researchers use my data?</h3>
<p>
Yes. Users will sign a data use agreement stating that they will acknowledge contributors by
citing the paper(s) or unpublished sources associated with the original data set or tools, 
including a URL that points to the location of their contribution in the open share, and
citing a paper describing OpenSHARE and OpenSHAPA.
</p>
<h3>What can I contribute?</h3>
<p>
<b>Data contributors</b> can share raw digital video files, other data streams (e.g., audio, motion
tracking, eye tracking coordinates, physiological data, transcripts), papers based on the data,
associated metadata (e.g., coded spreadsheets, codebook, questionnaires, instruments,
analysis spreadsheets), and a handful of tags describing the overall dataset that reflect standard
federal guidelines (number of participants at various ages and their sex, race, ethnicity, and
geographical region, typically/atypically developing) and study design (human/animal, naturalistic/experimental, cross-sectional/longitudinal).
These rich forms of metadata will help users to search for appropriate datasets
within the open share, browse the videos within datasets for particulars, and make greater use of datasets for
research and teaching. 
</p>
<p>
As will be noted in the consent forms, participants' faces and behaviors will be viewable on the
videos, and sometimes their first names will be spoken. As is customary, in text files and spreadsheets,
participants should be denoted by subject number whenever possible, not be denoted by their names. Last names, volatile
information, and other identifiers should be removed from text files and spreadsheets and bleeped out of videos.
</p>
<p>
<b>Tool contributors</b> can share tools and algorithms for visualizing, exploring, and analysing data,
and other uses. Links and scripts will enable interoperability between coded data and tools. Open
source tools can share the source code.
</p>
<h3>How do I protect the confidentiality of my participants?</h3>
<p>
Contributors are responsible for obtaining appropriate IRB clearance for open data sharing. Template
consent forms will be available on the OpenSHARE website. Users will sign a data use agreement before
gaining access to any data that are not already publically accessible.
</p>
<p>
If necessary, it is possible to password protect datasets to limit access to particular users.
Contributors can use video blurring to protect participant confidentiality, but this is difficult to
implement and limits the useability of the data.
</p>
<h3>How can I use the open share repository?</h3>
<p>Consistent with NIH guidelines on data sharing, researchers can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Upload their own video data and metadata for sharing and archival storage so that their data will survive in usable form beyond their lifetimes</li>
  <li>Enhance teaching by extracting video clips that illustrate an empirical or theoretical point and showing it to their students</li>
  <li>Enhance classroom lessons by allowing students to observe and score children's behaviors or to run "mini-studies" across the data store</li>
  <li>View archived data for exemplars to stimulate new work, make comparisons with their own work, and reinforce open scientific inquiry, to check how coding was done, see what displays or apparatuses were used, and gather detailed information to understand better how conclusions were drawn</li>
  <li>Browse the database to stimulate ideas that lead to further research</li>
  <li>Expand their own sample sizes, run replication studies, examine cohort effects, and assess possible differences due to geographical location or population by using suitable data in the archive</li>
  <li>Integrate data across archived studies to create new datasets or to conduct meta-analyses on raw data or metadata</li>
  <li>Build on other researchers' codes and prior coding efforts to extend or transform prior analyses and promote further discovery, and return the results to the archive</li>
  <li>Score archived data for behaviors that were outside the scope of the original study and then return the results to the archive</li>
  <li>Use the video data themselves as stimuli in new studies</li>
  <li>Use archived data for new purposes in fields outside developmental psychology</li>
  <li>Use archived data to test the performance of visualization, exploration, and analysis tools</li>
  <li>Use various tools contributed to the archive to enhance understanding of their own data</li>
  <li>Collaborate with like-minded researchers in a sub-area of development to create corpora of data with shared coding schemes and other metadata, as exemplified by TalkBank</li>
</ul>
<h3>How do I get access to the repository?</h3>
<p>
At a surface level, anyone will be able to browse through the archive to see what studies are posted,
but they will not be able to stream video data or have access to metadata beyond what is already
publically available (e.g. published papers, conference presentations, images released for open viewing on the web).
</p>
<p>
Only researchers affiliated with institutions with an IRB will be able to fully search the open
share repository, stream or download video, and enjoy full access to metadata. Users will set up an
account and sign a data use agreement. 
</p>
<h3>Who can contribute data or tools to the open share repository?</h3>
<p>
Any researcher with appropriate IRB clearance can contribute developmental or behavioral data. The current list of
contributors and pledged contributors are posted on the OpenSHARE website. 
</p>
<p>
Most potential contributors did not originally clear their studies through their IRBs with open data
sharing in mind. Thus, most of our contributors are -- at present -- pledging their contributions until
their studies are cleared for open data sharing.
</p>
<p>Any researcher can contribute tools to the repository.</p>

<h3>How do I contribute?</h3>
<p>Uploading files will be easy, quick, and painless with the OpenSHARE data management tools.</p>

<h3>When do I contribute?</h3>
<p>
Data contributors can upload data at any point and release it openly at any point—as data are
collected, after scoring the data, after manuscript submission, when a manuscript goes to press, or later.
</p>
<p>
Tool contributors can share their stuff and release it at any point—as the tools are being developed,
after testing, after a manuscript goes to press, or later.
</p>

<h3>How can I search the database?</h3>
<p>
To search for appropriate datasets, users type in relevant words or phrases (e.g., infant, Smith,
language, 12-month-old, 2011). If these words are present in the abstract, manuscript, coding manual,
spreadsheets, or other metadata associated with the study, studies, video clips or portions of video
clips might be returned. 
</p>
<p>
To navigate within datasets and search results, users could browse by relevance, time sample, or event sample.
</p>

<h3>Do I have to use OpenSHAPA to contribute?</h3>
<p>
No. Contributors are not required to score their data with the OpenSHAPA coding tool. However,
we encourage them to use OpenSHAPA because it is free and open source and every user strengthens
and grows the community. 
</p>
<p>We will work towards round trip interoperability between OpenSHAPA and other free or low-cost
academic tools (TalkBank, Elan, Transana). We are also aiming to build one-way translation between
commercial tools (e.g., Noldus, Mangold) and OpenSHAPA.
</p>
<h3>How will using OpenSHAPA and joining the OpenSHARE improve my science?</h3>
<p>
The OpenSHAPA coding tool, OpenSHARE data management tools, and data and tools in the open share
will help researchers to discover more, faster.
</p>
<h3>How do we build a sustainable user community?</h3>
<p>
Become a user and/or a contributor of data, tools, and open source code. Share your suggestions and
needs with the community by adding comments to the wikis or helping others on the OpenSHAPA support forum.
